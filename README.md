# Algorithms

#### Big O notation
- O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.
- O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.
- O(n * log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort
- O(n^2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort
- O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson

#### Arrays and List
Arrays provide random access and Lists provide sequential access 
|    Operation           | Arrays | Lists |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Reading  | O(1)  | O(n))  |
| Insertion  | O(n)  | O(1)  |
| Deletion  | O(n)  | O(1)  |
